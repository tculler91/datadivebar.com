*"Because the government sure as shit ain't comin' to save your sorry ass, and neither is the mayor, and neither is your mama"*

---

The fellas over at Data Dive Bar asked me to write some articles for their website on account of I am the most qualified sumbitch in the state of Iowa, and possibly the whole goddamn country, when it comes to stayin' alive when everything goes tits up. I told 'em I ain't no writer. I drive a damn Econoline van. I haul shit to places nobody's ever heard of for money that ain't worth talkin' about. I ain't got a degree. I ain't got a computer, I'm typin' this on Brenda's laptop that takes six damn minutes to boot up and smells like cat piss because her worthless orange bastard of a cat, Pumpkin, sprayed on it last March and we been pretending that didn't happen ever since.

But they said, "Bobby, people need to hear this." And hell, they're right. They damn sure are right. Because if the shit hits the fan tomorrow, and brother it WILL, most of you dipshits are gonna be runnin' around like chickens with your heads cut off while Bobby Lugnuts Duggan is sittin' pretty with enough water and supplies to last till Christmas. So here I am. Writin' an article. For the internet. Lord have mercy.

My name is William Ray Duggan but every sumbitch from here to the Mississippi knows me as Bobby Lugnuts. Don't worry about how I got the name. It involves a tire iron, a case of Busch Light, a county fair in 1994, and a bet I shoulda never taken. I won the bet though. Damn right I did.

I am 55 years old. Five foot nine. North of two hundred pounds and I don't give a good goddamn exactly how far north because I ain't gettin' on no scale. That's between me and Jesus. I wear a Mossy Oak camo hat from ought-three that looks like it's been through a war. It has. The war is my life. I survived Vietnam, for Christ's sake. U.S. Navy, rescue diver, Tonkin Gulf, '69 and '70. I pulled boys out of water so dark and nasty you couldn't see shit. I did that while half the country was back home smokin' dope and protestin'. I didn't complain about it then and I ain't complainin' now, I'm just sayin', it'd be nice if the mayor of my own damn town would cut me some slack on the truck in the driveway considerin' I SERVED THIS COUNTRY but no, Gary's gotta send me another goddamn letter. More on that in a minute because I cannot help myself.

I also survived an F5 tornado on I-80 in Nebraska haulin' forty thousand pounds of steel coils doin' about eighty-five and I tell that story a lot and I don't give a shit if you're tired of hearin' it because when YOU outrun an F5 tornado in a Peterbilt you can tell YOUR story a lot. Until then, shut up and listen to mine.

I also survived a divorce. I also survived eatin' gas station sushi in Bakersfield, California, which was honestly worse than the tornado. And I am currently survivin' a relationship with a woman named Brenda who I been in love with since high school and who has told me on multiple occasions that I am "the most exhaustin' human being on earth," which I take as a compliment because at least I'm number one at somethin'.

Anyway. This here's an article about water. You need it. You probably don't got enough of it. And you're gonna die without it. Let's get into it.

## The Goddamn Truck (Yes, I'm Talkin' About It, Settle Down)

Before we get into survival shit I gotta address the elephant in the room, or more accurately, the 1985 Ford F-150 in the driveway. Brenda's driveway. It's always Brenda's driveway when it's convenient for people to remind me I don't own the house and don't pay rent, but it's MY driveway when they want to bitch about the truck. Funny how that works.

Seventh generation. Straight six. Two-tone brown and tan. She is the most beautiful damn truck that was ever manufactured and she has not run since 2005 and I don't wanna hear a goddamn word about it. She'll run again. I'm gettin' to it. I been gettin' to it for twenty years but that is nobody's business. The fact that there's trees growin' outta the truck bed and possums livin' under the front axle is, in my opinion, just nature sayin' she likes the truck too. If nature ain't complainin', why the hell is Gary?

Gary is the mayor. I call him Mayor Dipshit. Fourteen letters he sent me. Fourteen. "Mr. Duggan, please remove the inoperable vehicle." "Mr. Duggan, the town council has received complaints." Mr. Duggan this. Mr. Duggan that. Listen, Gary. I built my high school's football stadium when I was sixteen years old with nothin' but a John Deere tractor and a disc plow because nobody else had the balls to do it. Coach Dempsey, God rest his soul, stood there and watched me grade that field and he said, "Bobby, you're the only kid I got who ain't completely useless." That's called CHARACTER, Gary. Try gettin' some.

Thirty-seven turkeys signed a petition sayin' my truck is an eyesore. An EYESORE. In a town of fourteen hundred people where half the buildings look like they're one stiff breeze from collapsin'. The hardware store still has a Reagan campaign sign in the window. But sure. MY truck is the problem. That is a bunch of horseshit and every single one of you knows it. The truck stays. Case closed. Subject over. Next person who brings it up is gettin' a piece of my mind and possibly a piece of my fist and I am fifty-five years old with bad knees but my hands work just fine.

Now. Water.

## Chapter 1: Water, and How I Damn Near Died Over a Six Dollar Chicken Fried Steak

Every survival article, book, pamphlet, whatever the hell, starts with water. You know why? 'Cause you're dead without it, stupid. Three days. That's all your body gives you. Seventy-two hours and your kidneys say "to hell with this" and your brain turns to soup and that's all she wrote. Game over. Done. Deader than shit. Deader than my marriage. Deader than Dale Earnhardt, rest his soul, greatest driver that ever goddamn lived and I will throw hands with any son of a bitch who says otherwise, I don't care if I lose, I WILL swing.

Water is more important than food. More important than shelter. More important than ammo, and I got a bumper sticker about my feelings on the Second Amendment that makes my position pretty damn clear, so you know that ain't a statement I make lightly. Water is more important than diesel fuel. And brother, I have cried, REAL tears, at a Pilot Flying J, watchin' diesel prices drop. Those beautiful bastards. God bless Pilot Flying J. If they ran the government this country would work. Instead we got dipshits in suits who can't find their own ass with both hands and a flashlight runnin' things, and that, friends, is why we need to talk about storin' our own water, because countin' on these turkeys to keep the pipes runnin' is a bunch of malarkey and you damn well know it.

You wanna know how I know about dehydration? 'Cause I almost died from it. Not in Vietnam. Not in the jungle. Not in the ocean where I was pullin' half-drowned sailors out of pitch-black water for Uncle Sam while your daddy was watchin' Hee Haw. No. I almost died in goddamn NEBRASKA. In a truck stop parking lot. Because of a six dollar chicken fried steak and a short order cook named Darryl.

### The Night Darryl's Chicken Fried Steak Tried to Kill Me

This was 2011 and I was still runnin' big rigs back then. Real trucks. Eighteen wheels. Loads that'd make the pavement crack. Not this Econoline horseshit I do now where I'm haulin' half-pallets of God knows what to towns so far out in the sticks it might as well be Bumfuck Egypt. I'm talkin' about Bumfuck Iowa, actually, which is the same as Bumfuck Egypt but with more soybeans and less history. I'm grateful for the work. I ain't proud. But Jesus Christ do I miss the big rig. I miss the open road so bad it hurts. Nothin' in front of you but highway. Nothin' behind you but some shithole town you couldn't wait to leave. That was freedom. That was LIVIN'. Now I'm drivin' Brenda's errands in an Econoline that smells like cat piss and broken dreams and I gotta smile about it. Happier than a dead pig in the sunshine, that's me. That's a lie. I am not happy. I am never happy. I am Bobby Lugnuts Duggan and I am permanently pissed off about everything and that is just how it is.

So it's August. Hotter than two rats screwin' in a wool sock. Hotter than the underside of Satan's ballsack. I'm haulin' steel coils to a stamping plant outside Kearney, which is the same kind of load I was runnin' when I outran that F5 tornado on I-80 back in '03. I know. I know. I talk about the tornado a lot. Bite me. You outrun a funnel cloud the size of God's angry fist doin' eighty-five with forty thousand pounds of rolled steel behind you and nothin' between you and kingdom come but a Peterbilt windshield, you'd talk about it too. The tornado went north. I went south. Whole damn highway behind me looked like God took a weed whacker to it. I pulled into a Pilot Flying J, God bless 'em forever and ever amen, and I sat in that cab shakin' for twenty minutes. Then I ate a burrito and got back on the road. That is what truckers do. We eat gas station burritos and keep movin'. It is our way.

ANYWAY. August 2011. I stop at this pissant little truck stop diner outside Kearney. Not a Pilot Flying J. That was mistake number goddamn one because Pilot Flying J has never, not one single solitary time, done me wrong. I order the chicken fried steak special. Six bucks. Comes with mashed potatoes that might've been real potatoes at some point in their sorry existence, gravy that looked like it came out of a caulk gun, and a dinner roll you coulda used to hammer nails. For six bucks you shut your mouth and eat.

The cook's name was Darryl. I know this because of his name tag and also because what that man did to my insides burned his name into my brain for the rest of my natural life.

I eat the chicken fried steak. It's fine. Fine enough. Not good, not terrible, just six dollars worth of fried mystery meat in the middle of nowhere Nebraska where the closest hospital is forty-five minutes away, which did not seem like relevant information at the time. It became the MOST relevant information on planet Earth about three hours later when my guts started makin' noises like a garbage disposal full of gravel.

What happened next, I ain't gonna get into all the way because there are some things a man oughta take to his grave and what Darryl's cooking did to my insides over the next forty-eight hours is one of 'em. I'll just say I was trapped in the sleeper cab bathroom of my rig, which if you ain't never seen one, imagine a porta-john that somebody bolted to a moving vehicle and then filled with the smell of diesel and human failure. I was in that bathroom for damn near two days. TWO. DAYS. I could not leave. My body was in full revolt. Every organ I got was tryin' to evacuate the premises. It was like a fire drill except the fire was inside me and the exit was... well, you get the picture. Shit got real. Literally. I'll stop there.

Here's the part that matters for this article: I ran out of water.

Two bottles of Aquafina. That's what I had. Two. I used one to try to stay alive and I used the other one for... sanitation purposes. The situation required it and I am not proud of it but the Navy taught me to improvise, adapt, and overcome, and by God I did all three of those things in that truck stop bathroom and Aquafina should honestly be thankin' me for the brand loyalty I showed under conditions that woulda made a lesser man just give up and die on the toilet.

By hour thirty-six I was in deep shit. No pun intended. Actually, pun intended. My mouth was dryer than a popcorn fart. My head was poundin' like a son of a bitch. I was dizzy. My heart was doin' some weird shit that I did not appreciate. That's when you start prayin'. That's when you start makin' deals with God. I said, "Lord, if you get me outta this bathroom alive, I swear I will pay Brenda rent. I will stop callin' the mayor a dipshit. I will deal with the truck situation."

I was lyin' through my teeth on every single count and the Lord knew it. But He bailed me out anyway. Probably on account of all them Navy boys I fished outta the South China Sea. Probably 'cause I built a whole damn football stadium with a John Deere tractor when I was sixteen. That's gotta be worth some heavenly credit. You'd think.

What actually saved my sorry ass was a trucker named Big Hoss from Tulsa who knocked on my cab door because he could hear me, and I am quotin' this directly, "makin' sounds like a cow gettin' run through a wood chipper." Big Hoss gave me a gallon of water and two Gatorades and stood outside my truck while I ugly cried for twenty solid minutes. No shame. None. Big Hoss, if you're readin' Data Dive Bar dot com, which I seriously doubt, you are a goddamn American hero and I owe you forty bucks for them Gatorades. I ain't forgot. I just ain't paid yet. That's a different thing. Don't look at me like that.

### So What the Hell Did I Learn (Besides Don't Eat at Darryl's)

The whole point of me tellin' you that disgusting story is this: dehydration will creep up on you like an ex-wife's lawyer. One minute you're fine and the next you're hallucinatin'. I hallucinated Dale Earnhardt leanin' against my truck bumper tellin' me to drink some damn water. He wasn't there. But I listened anyway because you ALWAYS listen to Dale. Even hallucination Dale. Even ghost Dale. Rest in peace, number 3. I'm gettin' emotional. Movin' on.

After the Nebraska incident I swore on my mama's Bible I would never get caught without water again. And I haven't. So here's what I do, and what your dumb ass should do too, and I say that with love. Sort of. Not really. I don't know you. But I don't want you to die, 'cause then who's gonna read my articles?

One gallon of water per person per day. That is THE number. Carve it into your forehead. Tattoo it on your arm. Tell it to your kids. Hell, tell it to your dog, I don't care, just remember it. One gallon. Per person. Per day. If you got four people in your house, that's four gallons a day. If you're plannin' for two weeks, and you better be plannin' for at least two weeks because when shit goes sideways it don't go sideways for just a damn weekend, that's fifty-six gallons. Yeah. It's a lot. You know what's more than a lot? Being dead. Dead is a lot more than a lot. So shut up about the cost and start fillin' up containers.

I got water stashed all over hell and half of Georgia at this point. There's water in the Econoline. There's water in the shed out back, right next to the tools I keep promisin' Brenda's daddy Jack I'm gonna use to fix things around the house. Jack hates me. Let me be clear about that. That man looks at me the way a dog looks at a bath. He knows I don't pay rent. He knows about the truck. He knows I eat his food and sleep in his daughter's house and contribute, in his words, "absolutely goddamn nothin'" to the household, and honestly? I can see his point. But I ain't leavin'. And neither is my emergency water supply, Jack. Deal with it.

There's water under Brenda's bed. Fourteen bottles. She don't know about those. If she's readin' this, surprise, sweetheart. Don't be mad. It could save your life. Actually she's definitely gonna be mad. Worth it.

And there's water in the F-150. Thirty-two bottles in the cab. Twelve more in the bed underneath the volunteer trees. That truck that everybody and their brother wants me to haul off to the scrapyard? She is a SUPPLY DEPOT. She is a strategic survival asset sittin' right there in the driveway and every one of you thirty-seven petition-signin' busybodies should be thankin' me instead of runnin' your mouths down at the diner. When the water supply goes to hell and you're all runnin' around like a bunch of turkeys in a thunderstorm, Bobby Lugnuts is gonna be sittin' on the porch happier than pigs in shit with enough water to last till spring. And I might share. MIGHT. Depends on whether you signed that petition. I got the list, Gary. I got the damn list.

### How to Make Shitty Water Less Shitty

Alright, let's say the world's gone ass over teakettle and you need water but all you got is a pond or a creek or the runoff from your neighbor's above-ground pool that ain't been cleaned since the Obama administration. You can't just drink it like that. You'll get parasites and bacteria and all kinds of nasty crap that'll have you prayin' for death on a toilet just like I was at Darryl's truck stop, and trust me, you do NOT want that. That is a place you do not wanna go. I been there. It ain't good. Pack a lunch, 'cause you're gonna be there awhile.

So you gotta purify it. Three ways to do this, and none of 'em are complicated, which is good because most of you are dumber than a bag of hammers and I mean that with all the respect it deserves, which is zero.

Boilin' is the easy one. Get the water to a rolling boil, keep it there for sixty seconds, and you're good. All the bad shit dies. If you're way up in the mountains, like above six thousand feet, go for three minutes because apparently the boilin' point is different up there or some nerdy horseshit like that. I didn't go to college. I went to Vietnam. But the Navy taught me one thing: listen to the nerds. The nerds know shit that'll keep you alive. God bless every last one of them nerds.

Bleach. Yeah, bleach. I know it sounds crazy as a shithouse rat but regular old unscented Clorox will make creek water safe to drink. Eight drops per gallon if the water's clear. Sixteen if it's cloudy or you fished a dead somethin' out of it before you scooped it up, which, yes, has happened to me, and no, I don't wanna talk about it right now because this article is already longer than I planned and I got strong feelings about what I found in that pond. Eight drops, stir it up, wait thirty minutes. It's gonna taste like a YMCA swimming pool. Tough titty. You're alive. Quit your bellyachin'. I once drank radiator runoff in a Walmart parking lot in Tulsa because that was my only option and compared to that, bleach water tastes like a damn piña colada. Don't drink radiator runoff though. That's free advice. I'm full of free advice. None of it's good but all of it's free.

Filtration. Get a real filter. Not a Brita. A Brita is a toy. A Brita is what people in the suburbs buy so they can feel like they're roughin' it while they sip filtered tap water in their two hundred thousand dollar kitchen. That is a bunch of malarkey. I'm talkin' about a Sawyer Squeeze or a LifeStraw or one of them big-ass Berkey units that sit on your counter like R2-D2's uglier brother. They filter out everything. Bacteria. Parasites. Dirt. Sadness. I made up that last one but honestly if any filter could remove sadness I'd buy twelve of 'em and bolt one straight to my face. The only thing a filter can't fix is the look on Jack's face when I come downstairs every mornin' and eat his eggs. That requires either therapy or a complete absence of shame. I chose the second one and it's workin' out just fine.

### Your Water Heater, a.k.a. the Thing in Your Basement You Forgot About

Most people are dumber than a sack of wet mice. I say that with love. Kind of. The point is, your hot water heater is sittin' there right now with forty to eighty gallons of drinkable water in it and you didn't even know it. Forty to eighty goddamn gallons just hangin' out in your basement doin' nothin'. If the water stops runnin', and it will, because nothin' in this country works worth a damn anymore, all you gotta do is turn off the gas or electric to the unit so you don't blow yourself to kingdom come, open the drain valve on the bottom, and catch what comes out. Boom. Two to three weeks of drinkin' water you already paid for.

If you blow yourself up because you forgot to turn off the power first, well, that's Darwinism doin' its job and I ain't gonna feel bad for you. Actually I will feel a little bad. But mostly I'll be annoyed that you didn't listen. I hate it when people don't listen. It pisses in my Cheerios somethin' fierce.

### Catchin' Rain and Pissin' Off the Government (Two Birds, One Stone)

Some states, and I am not makin' this up, have laws that say you cannot collect rainwater off your own roof into your own bucket on your own property. The sky. THE SKY. Drops water. God's water. Free water. From clouds that ain't owned by nobody. And some jackass in a government cubicle who probably couldn't change a tire to save his worthless life decided that is illegal.

That is the biggest bunch of horseshit I have heard in my life, and I have heard a LOT of horseshit. I used to deliver loads to Long Island, New York. You wanna talk about horseshit? Every dipshit on that island drives like a bat outta hell with no turn signals and no goddamn manners. I watched a man in a BMW cut me off, flip ME the bird, and then rear-end a cop car in the span of about ten seconds. I laughed so hard I almost jackknifed the rig. Long Island is proof that God has a sense of humor and that sense of humor is cruel. Biggest collection of dipshits I have ever encountered, and I been to forty-six states. Forty-six. Nobody else comes close. Long Island is the undisputed dipshit capital of the world.

Where the hell was I. Rain. Right.

In Iowa you CAN collect rain, thank the sweet baby Jesus, because if you couldn't I woulda snapped a long time ago. Longer ago than I already snapped, which Brenda says was around 2014. Set up your gutters, run 'em into barrels, filter what you collect, and you got free water that fell outta the sky because God loves you, or at the very least He tolerates you, and either way it's more than the government does.

### A Quick Word About Bobby Lugnuts and Money

Some of you, especially if you're from my town, are sittin' there readin' this thinkin', "Bobby, all this survival gear costs money, and aren't you the guy who won fifty grand on a scratch-off and ain't done a damn thing with it?"

Let me make somethin' real clear right now. I do not know what anybody is talkin' about. I buy a scratch-off now and then at the gas station like a normal American. Most of 'em don't hit. Some people in town like to run their mouths at the diner sayin' I'm sittin' on a pile of money. Some people say the IRS got it all. Brenda swears up and down I won big and I'm hidin' it. Brenda also swears I proposed to her once and she turned me down, which is, and I cannot stress this enough, a bunch of malarkey that I do not wish to discuss ever, not in this article, not in the next article, not on my deathbed. That did not happen. She is makin' that up. My face is red right now because I'm angry, not because I'm embarrassed. There's a difference. Shut up.

Point is, you don't need fifty grand or any other amount of money that may or may not exist to store water. Save your milk jugs. Rinse 'em out. Fill 'em from the tap. Get food-grade buckets from the bakery at the grocery store, most of 'em give those away for free if you ask nice. I know "askin' nice" ain't exactly my strong suit. Brenda says I got the social skills of a raccoon with a head wound. That is not untrue. But even I can ask for a bucket. You can too. Probably. Hopefully. Lord help us all.

And I'll say this one more time. If everything goes to hell and you ain't got water and Bobby Lugnuts rolls up in the Econoline with six months worth of supplies and that 1985 F-150 finally runnin' again with the truck bed loaded down with provisions... you will say thank you. You will apologize for the petition. You will tell Gary to go pound sand. And you will never, EVER say the word "eyesore" in my presence again.

That's a promise. And unlike my alleged proposal to Brenda, which DID NOT HAPPEN, I keep my damn promises.

### What to Remember From This Article

Water kills you faster than starvation does. Three days. That's your window. One gallon per person per day and not a drop less. Store it everywhere. Boil it, bleach it, or filter it. Your water heater's got forty to eighty gallons you forgot about. Catch rainwater because it's free and it makes the government mad, which in my book is a bonus. Don't eat chicken fried steak from a cook named Darryl. Don't drive through Long Island unless you wanna lose your faith in humanity. Dale Earnhardt was the greatest. Pilot Flying J is a national treasure. The truck in the driveway is a survival asset and she stays right the hell where she is.

That's all I got for now. The Data Dive Bar boys tell me I'm gonna be writin' more of these, which means you poor bastards are stuck with me. I got articles comin' on food, shelter, security, first aid, and what to do when society collapses and your neighbors start actin' like the dipshits on Long Island. It's gonna be a hell of a ride.

Until next time, don't let nobody piss in your Cheerios.

Bobby Lugnuts out.
