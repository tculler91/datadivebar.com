*"Because the government sure as shit ain't comin' to save your sorry ass, and neither is the mayor, and neither is your mama"*

Data Dive Bar asked me to write some articles on account of I am the most qualified sumbitch in the entire state of Ohio — and I will fight any man who says otherwise, and I mean that literally, I got bad knees but my hands work just fine. I told 'em I ain't no writer. I haul crap in a Ford Econoline that smells like a wet dog farted inside a tire fire, and I'm typin' this on Brenda's laptop that takes six damn minutes to boot up and smells like cat piss because her orange shitstain of a cat, Pumpkin, sprayed on it last March and we been pretendin' that didn't happen ever since. But they said people need to hear this. Brother, they are correct. Because if everything goes sideways tomorrow — and it WILL, this country's infrastructure is held together with duct tape, wishful thinking, and the sheer stubbornness of underpaid pipe workers — most of you are gonna be running your mouths at some FEMA tent askin' where the free water is, and Bobby "Pinkeye" Duggan is gonna be sittin' on the porch with enough stored water to last till April, laughin' his ass off. I will be wearing my aviator sunglasses, as I almost always do, for reasons I don't discuss publicly.

I am 55 years old. U.S. Navy rescue diver, Persian Gulf, '91. Pulled half-drowned boys out of water so dark and nasty you couldn't see your own hand in front of your face. Survived an F5 tornado haulin' forty thousand pounds of steel coils doin' eighty-five on I-80 in Nebraska — I talk about this a lot and I don't apologize for it; you outrun a funnel cloud the size of God's angry fist in a Peterbilt and see how often YOU bring it up. I also survived a divorce, gas station sushi in Bakersfield, California — which was genuinely worse than both the Gulf and the tornado put together — and I am currently survivin' a relationship with a woman named Brenda who told me last Tuesday that I am, direct quote, "a goddamn exhausting shitstorm of a human being." I take that as a compliment because at least I'm the best at something. Anyway. Water. Let's get into it before I ramble any more, which I will absolutely do.

## Chapter 1: Water, and Why You're Gonna Die Without It

Every survival article starts with water. You know why? 'Cause you're dead without it, stupid. Three days. Seventy-two hours and your kidneys say "to hell with this" and your brain turns to soup and that's all she wrote. Deader than shit. Deader than my marriage. More important than food, more important than shelter, more important than ammo, and I got a bumper sticker about the Second Amendment so you know I don't say that lightly.

### The Night Darryl's Chicken Fried Steak Tried to Kill Me

How do I know about dehydration? Because I almost died from it. Not in the Persian Gulf. Not pullin' half-drowned sailors out of pitch-black water at two in the morning for Uncle Sam while your daddy was home watchin' Hee Haw. I almost died in a goddamn truck stop parking lot outside Kearney, Nebraska, because of a six-dollar chicken fried steak and a cook named Darryl whose food did things to my insides that I will take to my grave. What I will say is this: I was in the sleeper cab bathroom for forty-eight hours straight. Two bottles of Aquafina. That's all I had. I used one to try to stay alive and I used the other one for sanitation purposes that the Geneva Convention probably has opinions about. The sleeper cab bathroom, for reference, is about the size of a broom closet that somebody welded to a diesel engine, and it smells like regret even under normal circumstances. By hour thirty-six, it was not normal circumstances.

My mouth was dryer than a popcorn fart on a hot August day. Head poundin' like a son of a bitch. I started hallucinatin' Dale Earnhardt leanin' against my front bumper, arms crossed, tellin' me to drink some goddamn water. He wasn't there. But I listened anyway, because you ALWAYS listen to Dale Earnhardt. Ghost Dale, hallucination Dale, regular Dale, doesn't matter — that man has never steered me wrong. What actually saved my sorry ass was a trucker named Big Hoss from Tulsa who knocked on my cab because, I'm quoting him direct here, he could hear me "makin' sounds like a cow gettin' run through a wood chipper." Big Hoss handed me a gallon jug and two warm orange Gatorades from his passenger seat, and I ugly-cried for twenty solid minutes outside my rig in a Nebraska truck stop at noon like a complete goddamn disaster of a human person. No shame. None whatsoever. Big Hoss is an American hero. I owe him forty bucks. I ain't forgot. I just ain't paid yet. That's a different thing.

### The Math

One gallon per person per day. That is THE number. Carve it in your forehead. If you got four people and you're plannin' for two weeks — and you better be plannin' for two weeks minimum, because when shit goes sideways it don't go sideways for just a weekend — that's fifty-six gallons. Yeah, it's a lot. You know what's more? Being dead. Dead is more than a lot. Shut up about the cost and start fillin' containers.

I got water stashed all over this property. In the Econoline. In the shed. Under Brenda's bed — fourteen bottles, she don't know about those, and if she's readin' this right now, hi sweetheart, don't be mad, it could save your life. And there's water in the 1985 Ford F-150 in the driveway that thirty-seven of my neighbors signed a petition about. Thirty-two bottles in the cab. Twelve more in the bed underneath the volunteer trees. That truck that everybody wants me to haul to the scrapyard? She is a strategic survival asset. She is practically a historic site. She ain't movin' for Gary or anybody else.

### How to Make Shitty Water Less Shitty

Say the grid goes down and the only water you can find is a pond that's been sittin' there since the Clinton administration with a dead carp floatin' in it and your neighbor's Labrador drinkin' out of it every morning. You cannot just cup your hands and chug that. I know it looks fine. It ain't fine. It'll have you prayin' for the sweet mercy of death on a toilet within twelve hours, and I mean that from personal experience — not the pond specifically, but the general category of "water I shoulda thought more carefully about." You gotta treat it first, and there ain't nothin' complicated about it. I didn't finish high school. I went to the Navy instead. I can explain this to you.

Boilin' is your best friend. Rolling boil, sixty full seconds, everything biological that was trying to murder you from the inside is dead. Above sixty-five hundred feet, go three minutes — something about altitude and boiling points, the nerds know why and I trust 'em. Second option: bleach, which sounds insane but isn't. Eight drops of plain unscented Clorox per gallon, stir it up, wait thirty minutes, drink it. Gonna taste like the shallow end of a public pool. Tough titty. You're alive. Alive is the goal. Third option: get a real filter. Not a Brita. A Brita is a toy for people in the suburbs who want to feel rugged while standing barefoot on heated tile floors. I'm talkin' about a Sawyer Squeeze or one of them big Berkey units that looks like R2-D2's uglier, drunker brother. Filters out bacteria, parasites, heavy metals, dirt, and the lingering sense of shame that comes from being the kind of person who didn't prep. Can't prove that last one. Working on it.

### Your Water Heater, a.k.a. the Thing in Your Basement You Forgot About

Your hot water heater is sittin' right now with forty to eighty gallons of drinkable water in it and you didn't even know it. Forty to eighty gallons just hangin' out in your basement doin' nothin'. Turn off the gas or electric to the unit first — don't blow yourself up, that's a real stupid way to go and I will have no sympathy — open the drain valve on the bottom, and catch what comes out. Two to four weeks of drinking water you already paid for. Done. That's it. That's the whole trick. Your plumber has been sitting on this secret your whole life.

### Catchin' Rain

Some states, and I am not making this up, have laws against collecting rainwater off your own roof. The SKY. Drops water on your property. God's water. Free. And some jackass in a government cubicle who couldn't change a flat tire if his life depended on it decided that's illegal. That is the single biggest pile of horseshit I have encountered in fifty-five years of livin', and I once drove through Long Island, New York, which I consider a nine-hour horseshit gauntlet.

In Ohio you CAN collect it, thank the sweet baby Jesus. Set up your gutters, run 'em into barrels, filter what you collect, and you got free water that fell out of the sky because God tolerates you, which is more than the government does.

### What to Remember

Thirty-seven people in this town signed a petition about the 1985 Ford F-150 in Brenda's driveway. Thirty. Seven. Gary sent me fourteen letters. Fourteen. Meanwhile the hardware store's had a Reagan campaign sign in the window since 1984 and nobody's petitioned about that. But my truck is the problem. Sure. Fine. You know what that truck has in it right now? When the water goes out — and it WILL — every one of them thirty-seven petition-signin' sumbitches is gonna be runnin' around in circles while Bobby "Pinkeye" Duggan is sittin' on the porch like a goddamn king. I might share. Might. Depends entirely on whether your name is on that list. I memorized the list, Gary. I know every name.

Water kills you faster than anything else. Three days, that's your window. One gallon per person per day. Store it everywhere — under the bed, in the car, in the shed. Boil it, bleach it, filter it. Your water heater has forty to eighty gallons you forgot about. Catch rainwater because God put it up there free and the government can go to hell about it. Don't eat anything cooked by a man named Darryl. Dale Earnhardt was the greatest driver that ever lived and I will throw hands with any son of a bitch who disagrees — arthritic knees, bad back, fifty-five years old, doesn't matter, I WILL swing. Pilot Flying J is a national treasure. And the truck stays.

Until next time: don't let nobody piss in your Cheerios.

Bobby Pinkeye out.
