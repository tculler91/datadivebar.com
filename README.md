## What Is This Place?

Data Dive Bar is an independent data, analytics, and culture blog with the soul of a sticky-floored dive bar and the brain of a stats department that got kicked out of academia.

We publish data-driven stories, interactive visualizations, and the occasional piece that probably shouldn't exist but does anyway.

## What's on the Menu

**📊 The House Pour** — Quick-hit data visualizations and stories. Pretty charts about ugly truths.

**🍺 On Draft** — Deep dives nobody asked for into datasets that absolutely did not need this level of attention. Rabbit holes with receipts.

**🕹️ The Barcade** — Original retro arcade games with live global leaderboards, built from scratch and powered by Firebase. Currently serving: *Bar Invaders* — defend your dive bar from waves of pretentious cocktails.

## The Vibe

No paywalls. No corporate sponsors. No dress code. Just honest analysis, strong opinions, and the freedom to publish a 3,000-word investigation into whether Mercury retrograde affects NFL kicker accuracy right next to a serious breakdown of March Madness seeding efficiency.

If the data is interesting, it belongs here.

## Tech Stack

- Static site hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- Custom domain via Namecheap (`datadivebar.com`)
- Firebase Realtime Database for Barcade leaderboards
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no build tools, no nonsense
