## What Is This Place?

Data Dive Bar is an independent data, analytics, and culture blog with the soul of a sticky-floored dive bar and the brain of a stats department that got kicked out of academia. 

We publish data-driven stories, interactive visualizations, sports analysis, and the occasional piece that probably shouldn't exist but does anyway. Because we do what we want, and if you don't like it, you can 'git' out!


## What You'll Find Here

**📰 Stories & Analysis** — Deep dives, hot takes backed by cold hard data, sports analytics, cultural investigations, and whatever else crawled out of the dataset.

**📊 Data Visualizations** — Interactive charts, maps, and graphics ranging from genuinely insightful to beautifully unhinged.

**🕹️ The Arcade** — Original minigames with global leaderboards. Built from scratch. Play for glory. Play for bragging rights. Play because you're avoiding real work.

## The Vibe

No paywalls. No corporate sponsors. No dress code. Just honest analysis, strong opinions, and the freedom to publish a 3,000-word investigation into whether Mercury retrograde affects NFL kicker accuracy right next to a serious breakdown of March Madness seeding efficiency.

If the data is interesting, it belongs here.
